Battleship is a type of strategy game that is played on a grid.

Here are the steps to play the game:

Setup:

When you open the GUI, you will have three options to select. Easy, Hard, and Multiplayer. In easy mode, you will be playing against an AI that randomly selects points to hit. In hard mode, the AI you are playing against has a strategic approach in which it attacks adjacent points in order to win the game. In multiplayer mode, you will be able to play against another human being. When you click on either easy or hard (I will explain multiplayer in another section below), you will see the game board. In the game board, your grid is on the bottom of the screen and the opponent's grid is on the top. In this version, the grids are 10x6.

You will see 5 ships on the ship dock, which you can see on the bottom right. The types of ships are:

- Aircraft Carrier (5 spaces)
- Battleship (4 spaces)
- Cruiser (3 spaces)
- Submarine (3 spaces)
- Destroyer (2 spaces)

To place the ships onto the grid, you will need to click on one of the ships and then click on one of the grid points. You will see 1 or 2 yellow colored grid points, which determine if you want the ship to go vertical or horizontal. Click on one of the yellow grid points to decide vertical or horizontal, then do the same for the other ships. Once you have placed all the ships, then you will need to click on the start button.

Extra Features:

While playing the game, you will notice that you are given additional features that will help you play the game better. The extra features are listed below:

- Tutorial
- ♫
- Hint
- Special Shots

The tutorial button adds a pop-up window that explains the basic rules of the game. This is helpful for people who have never played Battleship and need a better understanding of what needs to be done.

The ♫ button mutes both the background music as well as the sound effects. This is useful for people who want to play the game in a quiet environment, as the sound is not a necessity to play the game properly.

The hint button basically gives the player a hint on one of the tiles that has a ship on it. When the player clicks on this button, you will see a green tile on the opponent's board, which represents one of the ship tiles. This will help the player be able to figure out where the rest of the ship tiles are. This can only be done once

The special shots button allows the player to hit three tiles instead of one. When the player clicks on this button, two new buttons will pop up. These buttons are "V" and "H". These buttons determine if the shots are going to be vertical or horizontal. After this, select a tile as you normally do, and you will see multiple tiles being attacked. This can only be done once the player.

Playing the Game:

Once you start the game, you can click on any of the grid points and decide which one to attack. Once you click on a grid point, your opponent (AI or Human) will be able to select one of the grid points in your grid.

Hits and Misses:

When you click on a grid point, 1 of 3 things will show:

- Gray Color: This means that you hit the ocean and not a ship (miss)
- Red Color: This means that you have hit a part of the ship (hit)
- Ship Image: This means that you hit all parts of that ship, and it has been sunk (sink)

Goal:

The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships.

Winning:

The game will continue until you or your opponent has sunk all the ships. The player who sinks all their opponent's ships first wins the game! Once the game is over, you will be taken to another page, where the statistics and credits will be shown. You will also have the ability to restart or exit. Restarting will take you have to the beginning page, and exitting will close the application.

Multiplayer:

Once you click on the Multiplayer button in the startGUI you will see 2 text fields. You must enter a valid IP address and port to the corresponding text fields. If not you will get an alert that will allow you to try again or exit the application. To host the server enter your machine's IP address for your current network and a valid port. Then click the host button. Note: You can not run more than one server at a time on a given IP address and port. If you would like to join an existing server you must enter the exact same IP address and port as the host's server with no extra spaces or characters. You will then be connected and the game will follow the normal rules, except if the opponent has not started or it is not your turn, your Board will be disabled until it is your turn to play.

Alerts:

Each alert's title will give you a description of what error has occurred. The header and content texts will give you a description of what each button will do so you can choose accordingly.

Bugs: There is a bug that has occurred only a couple of times on my desktop where the MediaPlayer will throw an exception saying the media player could not be created. It only happened a couple of times and from the forums I have looked at it is an issue with Ubuntu Linux which is the OS I am using on my desktop. So far this error has not occurred on my Windows laptop, so I'm not sure if there is a fix as I wasn't able to find one for the Linux OS.
